# Challenge 5: Implement Single-Sign On for Tab

Users sign in to Microsoft Teams through their work, school, or Microsoft account that is Office 365, Outlook, you can take the advantage by allowing a single sign on to authorize your Teams tab/bot/messaging extension on desktop or mobile clients. If a user sign in once, they don't have to sign in again on another device as they're signed in automatically. Also, your access token is prefetched to improve performance and load times.
