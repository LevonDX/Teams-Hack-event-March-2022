Challenge 1 (1-1 Bot):
1. Create an 1-1 bot with the following Commands: 1. Create Ticket 2. Help
2. On Create Ticket the Bot just needs to reply back that it received the ticket (the answer should contain the ticket request) - a single line ticket is enough.
3. Help command should reply back with static text (we will provide the text).
