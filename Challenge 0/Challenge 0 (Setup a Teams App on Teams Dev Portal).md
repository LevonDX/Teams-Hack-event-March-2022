##Prepare a Developer Tenant for testing
You need a Microsoft 365 tenant to set up your dev environment.
After you have a tenant, you need to enable sideloading for your tenant, see [enable sideloading](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading). To verify if sideloading is enabled, sign in to Teams, select Apps -> Manage your apps and then check for Upload a custom app option.
