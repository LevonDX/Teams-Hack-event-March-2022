Challenge 2 (Channel Bot):
1. Extend 1-1 so it can be added to a team
2. Bot should have 2 commands: 
a. "Show Incidents" that will return a static list of Open tickets
b. "Show Incidents in Carousel" that will return the same list but in a carousel format
3. Welcomes a new user to the team. (??)
(Welcome user sample should be enough for this)
