# Challenge 2: Create a Teams Channel Bot

## Prerequisites

Complete Challenge #1, you should have an 1-1 Bot already setup.

## Description

Your mission for this challenge is to **extend** the Bot you created in the previous challenge, in order to have the following features:

1. The Bot should now have the functionality to be added on a Teams Channel.
2. The Bot should send a "Welcome message" when a user is added to the Teams Channel.
3. The Bot should have the below commands:
    1. **Support Tickets List**, that will return a "static list" of open support tickets as plain text. There is a predefined list of tickets that you can use [here](https://github.com/LevonDX/Teams-Hack-event-March-2022/blob/main/Challenge%202/Resources/SupportTickets.csv).
    2. **Support Tickets Card**, that will return the same list but using a ["Card Type"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference) that is supported by Teams.

## Success Criteria

1. Demonstrate to your coach that when you add a new user to the Teams Channel the Bot sends a "Welcome Message".
2. Demonstrate to your coach that the Bot has 2 commands on the "Team Channel" context as listed above.
